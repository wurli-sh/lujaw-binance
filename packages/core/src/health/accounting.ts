/**
 * An independent reconstruction of a Venus account's solvency.
 *
 * This module exists to disagree. The agent under test derives its collateral
 * figure from `Comptroller.getAccountLiquidity`, taking the protocol's own
 * verdict as authoritative and working backwards to the pieces. This model
 * never calls that function for its answer: it enumerates every position from
 * raw balances, prices each one at the oracle scale its decimals imply, weights
 * collateral by the liquidation threshold out of field 4 of the 7-field
 * `markets()` tuple, and adds the results up. The two routes are arithmetically
 * equivalent only when both are right, which is the entire point — a trial in
 * which the agent and the evaluator run the same code certifies the code's bugs
 * along with its correctness.
 *
 * `getAccountLiquidity` is still recorded, and the gap between it and this
 * reconstruction is reported as drift. It is a cross-check on this module, not
 * an input to it.
 *
 * Two rules govern what gets counted, and both err toward reporting more risk
 * rather than less:
 *
 *   Debt is enumerated across EVERY listed market plus VAI. `getAssetsIn` is
 *   not the debt universe. VENUS-ACCOUNTING-001 froze the case: an account with
 *   VAI debt and no vToken borrow reads as completely unleveraged to a reader
 *   that enumerates entered markets, and its true health factor is 2.505.
 *
 *   Collateral is counted only for markets the account entered, because that is
 *   what the Comptroller weighs. Un-entered collateral is real value that the
 *   protocol will not credit in a liquidation check, and crediting it here
 *   would overstate safety.
