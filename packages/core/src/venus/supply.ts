/**
 * The supply side of Venus, as raw readings.
 *
 * Same discipline as `observation.ts`, applied to a different question. This
 * module answers "what does the chain say about supplying into these markets"
 * and stops there. It exports no `bestMarket`, no `annualisedRate`, no
 * `isWorthMoving`. The agent and the reference model both read from here and
 * then reason separately, which is the only reason a supply-side trial means
 * anything.
 *
 * Three readings here exist because leaving them out produces a proposal that
 * reverts rather than one that is merely suboptimal:
 *
 *   `mintPaused` — testnet vBUSD is a listed market, carries a price, and
 *   rejects every `mint`. A reader that filters on `isListed` alone proposes
 *   into it.
 *
 *   `supplyCap` — a market at its ceiling rejects the mint that would cross it.
 *   Venus writes the cap as zero on retired markets, which means "no supply
 *   accepted", not "no limit".
 *
 *   `allowance` — `mint` pulls the underlying with `transferFrom`. The
 *   allowance is granted by the account's admin key and never by a session, so
 *   an agent that assumes it exists proposes a call the user's own account will
 *   fail to make.
 *
 * Rates are recorded per block, exactly as the protocol reports them. Venus's
 * interest-rate model on chain 97 sits behind a proxy that reverts on
 * `blocksOrSecondsPerYear()`, so there is no annualisation constant to read.
 * Any yearly figure is a stated convention, which makes it a policy input
 * rather than a fact, and facts are all this module carries.
