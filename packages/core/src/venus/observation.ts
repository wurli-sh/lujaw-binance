/**
 * Raw Venus observations.
 *
 * This package answers factual questions about chain state and nothing else. It
 * deliberately exports no `computeHealthFactor`, no `isAtRisk`, no
 * `calculateRequiredRepay`. The agent and the reference model both read from
 * here and then reason independently, which is the only reason a trial means
 * anything: if they shared one accounting implementation, a bug in it would
 * make the agent wrong and the evaluator agree, and the trial would certify the
 * error.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. An earlier shared implementation derived an
 * account's debt universe from `getAssetsIn`, which omits VAI. It reported an
 * account at health factor 2.505 as having no debt at all. See
 * VENUS-ACCOUNTING-001 in `fixtures/`.
 *
 * The observation below is therefore a record of what the chain said, with the
 * provenance of each reading attached, and no derived risk numbers whatsoever.
