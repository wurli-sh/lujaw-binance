/**
 * Turning a bare failure into a reason.
 *
 * The SDK returns `{ status: "FAILED" }` with no revert string, no error code
 * and no receipt. For MANDATE that is not merely inconvenient: the headline
 * proof is a rejection, and a rejection nobody can attribute proves nothing.
 * "The spend cap stopped it" and "the wallet was out of gas" look identical
 * from the SDK's return value.
 *
 * The distinction that matters most is `ExceededSpendLimit` against an ERC-20
 * allowance failure. Both stop the same transaction. Only one of them is the
 * product working, and a demo that mistakes the second for the first is
 * demonstrating a misconfiguration.
